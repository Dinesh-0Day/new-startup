# API Contracts

This directory stores versioned schemas for GraphQL and REST interfaces.

## Organization

- `graphql/` – GraphQL SDL files segmented by domain.
- `rest/` – OpenAPI specs when REST endpoints are exposed.
- `changelog.md` – Track published contract changes.

Publish a new contract by updating the schema file, running validation/tests, and documenting the change in the changelog.
