# Architecture Decision Records

Document key technical decisions with context, options, and outcomes.

## Workflow

1. Create a new ADR file using the format `ADR-XXXX-title.md`.
2. Record the decision, status, consequences, and alternatives considered.
3. Link related ADRs and update status when superseded.

Use the template in `docs/templates/adr-template.md` (to be created) for consistency.
